# template
Template repository that can be cloned within a project folder and used to create a python environment and git repository for that project. It includes the initial files (README, conda env yml, license, and python gitignore). Items should be  be customized before executing any processes (i.e. update the yml file to include whatever python packages you need for reproducible projects *before* steps 2-5 below).

1. Clone this repo where ever you want your project to be located.
2. Rename the repo from `template ` to your project/feature name, and then edit the name within in the yml file to match your project name. The yml file is used to create a python environment, and so editing the name and packages in the yml file should be done every time.
3. Fire up conda and change directory to the project directory using **$ cd C:\Users\Path\To\project_template**
4. Create conda environment with **$ conda env create**
5. Activate the conda environment with **$ source activate template**
6. To push the repository to Github, use Githubâ€™s hub command **$ git create** (or via GitHub's website UI), then push the master branch with **$ git push -u origin master**
